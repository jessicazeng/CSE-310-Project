User Interface Design
The user interface of this application uses the command-line text-based interface.

1.	Types of Commands
	The commands in this application is taken in as inputs to the command line. Each input is preceded by a question or prompt for the user to respond to. The inputs are menu options, dates, time frames, names, and yes or no responses. Each command takes in only one parameter. 

2. 	Formats of Commands
	
	2.1 Menu Options
		Menu option inputs are one character long. Valid menu characters are not case sensitive and must be in the range a to f. 

	2.2 Dates
		Date inputs include only the month and day in the format of mm-dd. Valid dates include: '12-1', '1-2', '12-22', '3-12'. Dates that are not excepted are: '12-01', '01-20'. *

	2.3 Time Frames and Time Slots
		Time slots must be in half-hour intervals. These intervals can only be in the form (spaces and dashes must be in this format as well): 'h:00 - h:30' or 'h:30 - h:00'. The h variable, or the hour, must also be in the range 0 to 23. *
		Examples: 	0:00 - 0:30
					12:30 - 13:00
					9:30 - 10:00
					23:30 - 0:00

		Time frames can be in half-hour intervals or one-hour intervals: 'h:00 - h:30' or 'h:00 - h:00' or 'h:30 - h:00'. *
		Examples:	3:00 - 6:00
					7:30 - 8:00
					8:00 - 8:30
					14:30 - 16:00
					20:30 - 21:30
					10:00 - 12:30
					20:00 - 21:00

	2.4 Names
		Names are not case sensitive. The users' names are first name only.

	2.5 Yes or No Responses
		These yes or no responses are one character inputs. These responses are either 'y' for yes or 'n' for no and are not case sensitive. *

	2.6 Authentication
		Authentication when the application starts takes in email and password inputs. The email input must be in the form 'xxx@xxx.xxx'. The password can be in any form and is not case-sensitive, but must match the server's account information. *

3. 	Expected output
	
	3.1 Menu Options
		The output after a menu option command depends on the menu option. It is usually followed by a prompt for another input.  

	3.2 Authentication
		After authentication a valid user account, the user screen will display a menu:
			Menu:
			a) view all available slots
			b) delete slots
			c) view available time slots for another user
			d) book a meeting
			e) book a meeting for a list of attendees
			f) exit

* Note that the single quotes are not included in the inputs to the application.
